This repository contains a TypeScript implementation of the classic bubble sort algorithm. The base algorithm is designed with extensibility in mind, allowing developers to easily apply the sorting logic to various data structures.

## Features

- ðŸš€ **Bubble Sort Algorithm:** A robust and extendable bubble sort implementation.
- ðŸ”„ **Sorter Abstract Class:** A `Sorter` abstract class to standardize the implementation across different types.
- ðŸ“š **Supported Types:** Implementations for sorting strings, number collections, and linked lists.
